## **Project Title**

**AI Based Autonomous Payroll Agent & Invoice Generator**

---

## **Introduction**

In many organizations, employees submit their monthly working hours and salary details through email. Manually reading these emails, extracting payroll information, and preparing salary summaries is inefficient and error-prone. With the help of **AI agent technologies**, this process can be automated intelligently.

This project proposes an **AI-based payroll agent** developed using **Python**, which automatically analyzes salary-related emails, extracts payroll data, updates records, and generates a monthly summary invoice for the company owner.

## **Objectives**

* To design an AI agent that monitors payroll emails
* To identify salary-related emails using AI
* To extract payroll information using NLP
* To update payroll data automatically
* To generate and send a monthly payroll summary invoice

---

## **Proposed System**

The system uses an **autonomous AI agent** that:

1. Monitors the payroll email inbox
2. Classifies emails related to salary and payments
3. Extracts employee details such as hours worked and salary
4. Updates payroll records in a spreadsheet or database
5. Generates a consolidated monthly invoice
6. Sends the invoice to the company owner
